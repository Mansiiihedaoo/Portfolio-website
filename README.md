Projects Section: This section displays a selection of my projects, each showcased with a project card featuring project details, skills used, and links to GitHub repositories and live demos. Project cards are designed with hover effects to provide an interactive experience.

Skills Section: Here, I list my technical skills and provide a brief description of myself as a Full Stack Web Developer. Skills are showcased with logos and hover effects for an engaging display.

Contact Me Section: Visitors can reach out to me using the contact form provided in this section. The form allows them to input their name, email, subject, and message, providing an easy way to get in touch.
